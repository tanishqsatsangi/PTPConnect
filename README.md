It could also be used by school and government to hold public meetings or lectures. The app focuses on providing a digital platform to the people of India to share knowledge and moments.
Presently the application is in development phase.
Platform:
The application will be accessible on all the three platform i.e. Android, iOS, and web.
The application is being developed in native platforms to provide all the relevant features based on platform and requirements. The app is being currently developed for android platform, after which it will be launched on iOS and web.
Robustness:
The app uses Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Cloud Storage to store the videos and streaming content and combined with Twilio video SDK it provides a fast and reliable streaming service it also provides a high-end security of data.Since GCP is a fully managed solution we don‘t need upfront investment in hardware. Their ultra-low latency ensures a positive user experience.
The SDK supports both Android and iOS which make it easier to add additional feature. It also uses SQL database which provide fast querying of data to the user
Since all the user related data is uploaded on GCP user can access its data from all the platform with restriction of streaming from 1 platform at a time. Where in private meeting it could simultaneously connect 50 people in a meeting and all the users in meeting can share screen.
The app uses a powerful SDK of Twilio to provide livestreams and also be used to hold private meeting or lectures with limited access to only those users who have meeting id or access link. 

Security:
Since, the GCP is highly secured we integrated Firebase Authentication to provide more security and ease of Access to the users as it provides Social Login which gives ease to user and strong authentication process. User can access its account on any platform and can keep its account logged in unless it logout or choose to logout from all devices.
User can also view which devices its currently logged into presently. Any livestream crossing the threshold report would be blocked from stream and will be sent to moderator for view and strict action will be taken like suspension of account if violation of rules is found.
No data or information is shared with any third party or internal person except the inhouse moderator who only view the content for violations related issues.
User Experience:
Since the design is user friendly. It’s easy for user to navigate from one option to another. With that also user has option to use Social login in order to login easily without hassle of signing up. User can choose between to livestream, lecture/webinar or to hold a private meeting. User can also create groups in which they can video call or chat. User can share join link for livestreams / meeting / lecture / webinar. While, it could also set password for joining a private meeting. User can share all types of files or documents in meeting as well as audio message, images and videos. Viewers can like, dislike and comment in livestreams and can follow livestream hosts to know about future livestreams.
